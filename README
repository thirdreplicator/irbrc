Move this file to ~/.irbrc and then you will magically have command history in both irb and script/console (if you're using Rails).

INSTALL
-------
git clone git@github.com:thirdreplicator/irbrc
mv irbrc/.irbrc ~/.irbrc

# If you're using RVM:
gem install wirble map_by_method

USAGE
-----
irb
# Type some Ruby commands
# Use <UP-KEY> on keyboard to see previous commands

Enjoy.
